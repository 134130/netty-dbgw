## Netty Gateway for MySQL Protocol

This project is a Netty-based gateway for the MySQL protocol, designed to intercept communication between MySQL clients 
and servers. It provides a customizable and extensible framework for handling MySQL protocol packets, enabling developers
to implement custom logic and features.

Your primary goal is to ensure that the gateway can handle MySQL protocol packets effectively, allowing for features such as
authentication, command processing, and response handling. The gateway should be able to parse and modify packets as needed.
